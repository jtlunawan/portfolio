          Therefore, it is important to know whether our prototype makes sense to our users, and what kind of value we could possibly deliver to them. 
          <hr/>
          Besides, based on the feedback we received, we should further work on the self-designed assets and maybe incorporate them with children themselves' doodling.

          It might be better if we could collaborate with school programs to implement the learning app in a more effective way.
